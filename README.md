## Synopsis

Paul Johnson's resume built off of moderncv.

## Installation

Requires a ful TeX environment with xelatex and pdftk.  I also recommend getting the following font files from Adobe: MyriadPro-LightIt.otf, MyriadPro-Semibold.otf, MyriadPro-Light.otf.  They can be purchased, or acquired through other means.  Put them in the same directory as resume.tex.  Then run ./create.sh to generate the resume pdf.
